				<h1>Imixs Process Manager</h1>
				<p class="lead">Welcome to the Imixs Business Process Manager
					Suite</p>




				<p>In order to successfully implement a business process, you
					essentially need two things:</p>

				<ul>

					<li>a process description which you ideally create using the
						BPMN 2.0 standard</li>
					<li>a runtime environment which allows you to execute and to
						persist your process instances</li>
				</ul>


				<p>
					The Open Source project <a href="http://www.imixs.org"
						target="imixs-workflow">Imixs-Workflow</a> provides you with a
					powerful workflow management platform that combines the design and
					the execution of business processes in a highly scalable and easy
					to use environment.


				</p>

				<p>
					With the Imixs Process Manager you can start quickly and develop
					and test your own models. And of course you can customize and
					extend this plantform and use it for development as well as for
					production. Imixs-Workflow is based on <a
						href="https://jakarta.ee/">Jakarta EE</a> providing you with a
					highly scalable server platform for modern microservice
					architecture.
				</p>

				<p>
					You can define your own business process models using the <a
						href="https://www.imixs.org/doc/modelling/index.html"
						target="imixs-workflow">Imixs-BPMN modeller tool</a> and you can
					upload and execute your models directly within Imixs Process
					Manager. General information about how to model can be found <a
						href="https://www.imixs.org/doc/modelling/howto.html"
						target="imixs-workflow">here</a>.

				<h3>Process Design</h3>

				<p>The Imixs Process Manager allows you to define custom forms
					for your business process without programming. By defining an XML
					template, you can store forms directly in a BPMN 2.0 model.</p>

				<img src="/pages/model-example.png" />
				<p>Example:</p>
				<pre class="code">
&lt;?xml version=&quot;1.0&quot;?&gt;
&lt;imixs-form&gt;
  &lt;imixs-form-section label=&quot;Order&quot;&gt;
    &lt;item name=&quot;_orderid&quot; type=&quot;text&quot; label=&quot;Order ID:&quot; /&gt;
    &lt;item name=&quot;_orderdate&quot; type=&quot;date&quot; label=&quot;Order Date:&quot; /&gt;
  &lt;/imixs-form-section&gt;
&lt;/imixs-form&gt;</pre>
				<p>You can create and change your models at runtime without
					interrupting your workflow instance.</p>
