				<h1>Imixs Process Manager</h1>

				<p>The digitization of business processes has become a key
					challenge for modern application design. Essentially, you only need
					two things to do this.</p>

				<ul>

					<li>a process description - which you ideally create using the
						BPMN 2.0 standard</li>
					<li>a runtime environment - which allows you to execute and
						persist your process instances in a secure way</li>
				</ul>


				<h2>Imixs Workflow</h2>
				<p>
					The Open Source project <a href="http://www.imixs.org" target="imixs-workflow">Imixs-Workflow</a>
					provides you with an
					open and powerful workflow management platform that combines the
					design and the execution of business processes in a highly scalable
					and easy to use environment.
				</p>

				<h2>Run with Docker</h2>
				<p>With the Imixs Process Manager you can start quickly and
					develop and test your own business process. And of course you can
					customize and extend this platform and use it for development as
					well as for production.</p>

				<h2>Imixs BPMN</h2>
				<p>
					You can define your own business process models using the <a
						href="https://www.imixs.org/doc/modelling/index.html" target="imixs-workflow">Imixs-BPMN
						modeller tool</a> and you can
					upload and execute your models directly within Imixs Process
					Manager. General information about how to model can be found <a
						href="https://www.imixs.org/doc/modelling/howto.html" target="imixs-workflow">here</a>.

				<h3>Process Design</h3>

				<p>The Imixs Process Manager allows you to define custom forms
					for your business process without programming. By defining an XML
					template, you can store forms directly in a BPMN 2.0 model.</p>

				<img src="/pages/model-example.png" />
				<p>Example:</p>
				<pre class="code">
&lt;?xml version=&quot;1.0&quot;?&gt;
&lt;imixs-form&gt;
  &lt;imixs-form-section label=&quot;Order&quot;&gt;
    &lt;item name=&quot;_orderid&quot; type=&quot;text&quot; label=&quot;Order ID:&quot; /&gt;
    &lt;item name=&quot;_orderdate&quot; type=&quot;date&quot; label=&quot;Order Date:&quot; /&gt;
  &lt;/imixs-form-section&gt;
&lt;/imixs-form&gt;</pre>
				<p>You can create and change your models at runtime without
					interrupting your workflow instance.</p>
